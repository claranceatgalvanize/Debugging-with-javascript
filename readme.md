# Counting Bugs

This project includes code that will organize bug species in a variety of ways. Unfortunately, it's currently all broken! Using your knowledge of debugging, fix the existing code so that all the tests pass.

When you add `console.log` statements, you can run the tests and see the log statements there! If you're having a hard time, work with an instructor.
